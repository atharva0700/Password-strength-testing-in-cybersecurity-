# Password-strength-testing-in-cybersecurity-

In cybersecurity projects, evaluating password strength is crucial for gauging the security of passwords utilized in systems or networks. This procedure encompasses setting up a password policy, encrypting passwords, and utilizing diverse cracking methods such as brute force, dictionary, and rainbow table attacks. Dedicated tools automate these efforts against hashed passwords acquired from the target system. Subsequently, analysis of the outcomes identifies weak passwords and areas needing enhancement, with detailed recommendations outlined in a report. Password strength testing is an ongoing process vital for upholding strong password security and fortifying systems against unauthorized entry.
